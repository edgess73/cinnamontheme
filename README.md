#:tw-1f4e5: Installation
1. Download *cinnamon.json* to your phone
> P.S GitHub mobile client cannot download files from repos, so you can use programms like ES file explorer (download manager), ADM (Advanced Download Manager), etc.

2. Copy *cinnamon.json*  to *themes*  in *Aluicord*  
> P.S If ypu don't have this folder you need to instal [Themer](https://github.com/Aluicord/DiscordThemer/releases "Themer") , enable it in `plugins` and restart Aluicord.

3. Go to `plugins` -----> `Themer` -----> `Settings` -----> `Load missing themes` -----> Enable `Cinnamon` and disable other themes -----> Restart.
> P.S Themer can load Cinnamon before starting, so you have not to do `load missing themes`
